# codewars-golang-challenges
Repository for Code Katas based on CodeWars Site: https://www.codewars.com/
Just a few code challenges in Go from the CodeWars Site. I decided to
give those katas a try to start refining my basic Golang knowledge.

The Journey has started, it has been certainly amazing to learn more about
this language and I could have not help but compare its simplicity to the one
on Python and its great way of managing types just like C Sharp, this is great indeed.

**Disclaimer:** I am rather new to Golang, bin fan of it but my language knowledge is quite basic just yet, hence, I leave my exercises on this repo but I am sure there are wait more efficient ways of doing these solutions with more sophisticated and faster algorithms.

Have fun with Golang!
